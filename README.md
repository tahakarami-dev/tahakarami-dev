### About Me
Backend developer with a strong focus on **WordPress engineering** and **Laravel-based backend systems**.  
I design and build scalable, secure, and maintainable web products with a clear **product and business mindset**.

My core expertise is developing **custom WordPress plugins and architectures from scratch**, while using Laravel to build structured backend systems, APIs, and background processes.  
I care deeply about clean architecture, performance, and writing code that survives real production environments.
